# Y1S2 Assignment
1. Contains the Original Assignment Document for our group project based on the topic **Construction Management System**
2. Contains the updated version of the source code which i rewrote 
3. The new source code still doesn't function like i want it to but i will update it eventually as my programming skills get improved
4. The original source code in the document is functioning fine but you won't expect any type of output
5. Reference to point 3: Why it doesn't work because there are some errors which i can't solve by myself yet until i get a better understanding of C++
6. For now this version of the code i posted here is known as **Version 1** and the version which is specified inside the document is **Version 0**
